# Odin-To-DoList-V2

Redoing TOP's To-Do list project. Going to improve code maintainability and readability this time by seperating the DOM from the application logic and separating necessary modules along with using modular patterns.

## Usage 

You can create the distributable HTML CSS and JS by running the command:

```
npm run dist
```

If you want to step into development mode you can use:

```
npm run dist:watch
```

## Code Style

I used semistandard, for lint checking run:

```
npm run lint
```

To fixing style:

```
npm run lint:fix
```
